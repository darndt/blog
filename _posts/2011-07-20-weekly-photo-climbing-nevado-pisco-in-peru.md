title: 'Weekly Photo: Climbing Nevado Pisco in Peru'
---

In the summer of 2008 I spent a few weeks climbing in Peru's Cordillera Blanca with Jim, an old college friend from Seattle.  We picked the [normal route up Pisco Oeste (5760 m/18898 ft)](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/271-pisco-oeste-5760-m) as our acclimatization climb.  This photo shows two Italian climbers tackling the final pitch to the summit.
