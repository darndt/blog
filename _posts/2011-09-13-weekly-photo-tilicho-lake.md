title: 'Weekly Photo: Tilicho Lake'
---

This was one of the highlights of my [trip to the Annapurna range in the Nepal Himalayas](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/139-annapurna-tilicho-trekking-with-chulu-far-east-climb):  Camping by one of the world's highest lakes, Tilicho Lake (4949 m).  I vividly remember the sight of this high mountain wall at the south shore of the lake as well as how cold it was.
