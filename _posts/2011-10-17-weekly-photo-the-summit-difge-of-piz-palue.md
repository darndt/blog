title: 'Weekly Photo: The Summit Ridge of Piz Palü'
---

The weather wasn't all that great when we [climbed Piz Palü by ski](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/308-piz-palu-3882-m-east-summit-via-normal-route-ski-tour). Most people didn't bother ascending the summit ridge in the fog and turned around at the saddle. But we felt good and continued, dumped the skies, and postholed our way up to the eastern summit to be rewarded with opening clouds and great views.
