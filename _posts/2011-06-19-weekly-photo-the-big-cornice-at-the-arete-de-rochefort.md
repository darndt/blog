title: 'Weekly Photo:  The Big Cornice at the Arete de Rochefort'
---

This is the Arete de Rochefort in the Mont Blanc massif, a high alpine ridge just below the 4000 m mark on the border between France (to the left) and Italy (to the south).  We were late and the winds were quite strong up there so we turned around at that point.  But having seen that huge cornice means that I'll have to go up there again one day to finish the traverse.  This photo was also recently published in the [Daily Telegraph's Ultratravel magazine](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activityandadventure/8361501/Mountain-climbing-holidays-Mont-Blanc-Mount-Kenya-and-Kilimanjaro.html).
