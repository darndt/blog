title: Resources for Forecasting Thermals
---
This is a collection of links for forecasting thermals for paragliders.  Based on my notes from a course by [http://robair.ch/](http://robair.ch/)  No guarantees of correctness, completeness etc!

* **Emagrams** (e.g. Payern): old, inprecise, complicated to read ==> don't use anymore, there are more modern tools available
* The only manual thermal forcast in Switzerland is from [Schaenis Soaring](http://www.schaenis-soaring.ch/wetter/streckenflugempfehlungen/)

## RASP (Regional Atmospheric Soaring Predictor)
* John Glending
* good for outside the Alps
* use **only** in winter and summer as the partially snowed in landscape in spring and fall messes up the prediction
* uses GFS (27km) --> WRF (bis ~2km) grids
* this is used by the following websites (same model, different presentation)
  * [http://meteo-parapente.com/](http://meteo-parapente.com/?lang=en) (free)
  * [http://soaringmeteo.ch/](http://soaringmeteo.ch/indexE.html) (free)
  * [http://www.cumulus.it/raspit/](http://www.cumulus.it/raspit/) (small cost)
  
## Regtherm/Alptherm/Toptherm
* more precise for Alps, **prefer over RASP when in the Alps**
* uses COSMO-7 model (7km grid)
* offered by these websites
  * [http://www.alpenflugwetter.com/](http://www.alpenflugwetter.com/) 
    * costs CHF 65 per year (but well worth it!)
    * very precise
    * lists the expected vertical thermal velocities for location and time of day/temperature:
      * velocity number should be **4 or larger** (4 * 0.5 m/s = 2 m/s), people use this to look at the forecast for their starting position and wait for takeoff until the precise time or temperature when the number is 4 or larger

## Other Stuff
* [http://www.thermikcheck.ch/](http://www.thermikcheck.ch/) people used this in the old days
* study pilot tracks at [http://www.xcontest.org](http://www.xcontest.org/world/en/)
* http://thermal.kk7.ch/ click on "Show Hotspots" and the download hotspot data to vario
* for wind forecast use the 800m-above-ground instead of the 10-m-above-ground as this is more relevant for us
