title: 'New project:  Weekly Photo'
---

I started taking photos many years ago on a Minolta film SLR.  In 2004 I switched to Canon and went digital.  Currently I shot on a Canon 550D (which takes HD video too).  I have accumulated thousands of photos, either taken on travel trips around the world or on my many mountain adventures.  Most of these photos serve to document a trip and are mostly interesting to me and my climbing buddies and not necessarily to anybody else.  But some of them are quite beautiful and I think they are worth sharing with others.
My aim is to unbury one of these photos every week and republish it on this blog.  We'll see how long I can keep up with this weekly rhythm...

I'll start with the one below (which is really a panorama stitched together from a bunch of shots). I've lived in Seattle for 5 years but it wasn't until a few weeks before I returned to Europe that I took my (newly acquired!) Canon 300D and tripod and went to Kerry Park in the Queen Ann Hill neighborhood to shoot the city's skyline from this famous vantage point with it's unique view of downtown Seattle, the Space Needle, the waterfront, and the harbor.  And behind it all is Mount Rainier looming which I had the fortune to [summit](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/46-mount-rainier-climb-via-emmons-glacier) [twice](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/69-mount-rainier-climb-via-kautz-glacier).
