title: 'Weekly Photo: Crossing Amphulapcha Pass'
---

This is from last year's [trekking trip in the Everest region of Nepal](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/366-nepal-solukhumbu-trekking-with-mera-peak-amphulapcha-and-island-peak) where we had to cross the 5845 m high Amphulapcha pass.  The ascend on the south side that involves climbing steep seracs was easy compared to the descend on the north side.  There everybody had to rappel a few rope lengths.  Easy for us "tourists" but quite a feat for our heavily laden porters!
