Petra in Jordan was one of the highlights of my [trip to the Middle East](http://www.danielarndt.com/travels/show/346-jordan-egypt-israel-west-bank).  It is simply amazing.  Because of the midday heat and the crowds I planned out my three day stay wisely:  After sightseeing in the morning, I returned to the hotel for a nap and went back to the site in the early evening.  Lots of walking this way but also lots of rewards like this one:  Seeing the Treasury from the Siq void of any people at 6:30am!
