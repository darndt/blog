##Climbing Mont Maudit

Wilfried and I climbed Mont Maudit via the normal route from Refuge Cosmiques.  We encountered perfect weather and great conditions even though it was already end of August, pretty late in the season for a fairly dry summer.

On Saturday we drove from Zurich to Chamonix, took the Aiguille du Midi gondola up and hiked the short hike to the Refuge Cosmiques.  

Sunday morning we got up at 2:45 for breakfast at 3am.  They offered 4 different breakfast times, at 1am, 3am, 5am and 7am to accomodate the varying lenght of the climbs.  For Mont Maudit, which is perhaps 2 hours shorter than the climb of Mont Blanc, we figured that 3am would be perfect.  We took our time and were on our way at 4:15.

We passed the Col du Midi and ascended the Glacier des Bossons to the north of Mont Blanc du Tacul to the Tacul shoulder.  This route changes every year.  This year here was no aluminum ladder necessary to cross crevasses like two years ago but the route was pretty steep in places.  This was no problem since the snow was fairly solid but it was a bit more of a challenge when we would descend it later in the day with softer snow.  When we arrived on the tacul shoulder we saw a few people heading to Mont Blanc du Tacul but we pressed on toward the steep snow slope that leads to the shoulder between Pointe Mieulet and Mont Mauditcol.  In the middle of the steep section there is a rock island perfect for belaying.  We were up at the shoulder in no time.  Instead of following the rocky ridge directly to the Maudit summit, as I had seen it described in a guide book, we continued the traverse to the Col de la Brenva.  There was a short icy section that needed some care but soon we were at the Col, turned north and a few minutes later, at around 9am, we had ascended the easy snow slope to the summit of Mont Maudit.  We had the summit to ourselves and enjoyed the great views.  Very close, perhaps 2km to the south, was the huge wide summit of Mont Blanc and 3500 m below we could see the town of Chamonix.

The descend was uneventful.  We followed the ascend route and both of us felt great so we were chatting the whole time.  I had worried before that we would have altitude problems since we weren't acclimatized at all for a night at 3500m and a summit of 4400m but neither of us had any problems whatsoever which was great!

The final ascend from the Col du Midi to the gondola at the Aiguille du Midi is always a bit of a bummer and so is encountering the tourist growds after 1,5 days of near solitude in the mountains...

All in all, this was a great weekend outing in a beautiful area.
