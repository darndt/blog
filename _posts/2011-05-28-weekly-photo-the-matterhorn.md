We had left the hut at 5am to [climb Zinalrothorn](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/296-zinalrothorn-4221-m-via-se-ridge), another 4000 m peak in the Zermatt area of the Alps, just opposite from the famous Matterhorn (4478 m).  It was a long day and it got late.  When the last sun rays hit the top of the Matterhorn this is what we saw.
