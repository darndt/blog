[This trip to Mont Blanc](http://www.danielarndt.com/trips/show/254-chamonix-success-and-failure) was quite a disaster:  With a late start on the first day we barely made it off Tour Ronde before nightfall.  On the next day we got caught in lightning on the Glacier du Geant.  We eventually made it to the hut just to be trapped there for another day by the snow storm (in August!).  When the clouds finally cleared our time was up and we had to drive home.
