title: Website Rewrite
---

My website [www.danielarndt.om](http://www.danielarndt.com) started many years ago as a bunch of static HTML files.  When I started to put up photos I used text files as a rudimentary database solution.  The website then went through a revamp every couple of years.  I switched to a real SQL database, used Perl, later PHP, before eventually settling on Ruby and Ruby on Rails with which I'm still happy.

However, weird legacy code and a database design from the Perl days were in the way of implementing new things and moving forward.  Hence a complete revamp was needed.  

During the past couple of weeks I switched to Ruby on Rails 3 and completely rewrote the website and the database backend.  There is a new (and hopefully nicer) design, new photos will be hosted by the awesome [Smugmug.com](http://smugmug.com).  Commenting on some pages and a blog has been added.  And lots of invisible improvements on the administrative backend.  

I hope you like it.
