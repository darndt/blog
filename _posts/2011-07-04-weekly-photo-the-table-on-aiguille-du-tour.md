title: 'Weekly Photo:  "The Table" on Aiguille du Tour'
---

The Mont Blanc massif is quite a drive from Zurich (3 hours) but it's always worth it!  Yesterday, we climbed Aiguille du Tour (3544 m) via the couloir de la table.  What a great climb:  A scenic glacier crossing at sunrise, followed by a snowy couloir, and finished by an exposed ridge traverse on famous Chamonix granite.  In the photo one can see Aiguille du Chardonnet on the left, followed by Aiguille Verte, and finally Mont Blanc, which is the chubby snow capped peak in the center of the shot.
